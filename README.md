For this App I created 4 Component Inside Component Folder:
- Navbar.js: This compnent is containing ***Header*** which have ***Date, Day, Month, Year***.
- Items.js: This component is containing ***List*** and ***Custom checkbox***. And this component is statefull Component.
            I used map function to display list from array and inside that map function I put checkbox so that every todo item has their own checkbox that             point to that particular item.

- AddButton.js: For the Addition Button at the bottom-center of page.

These all three component are functional component.

- Main.js: This is a class Component and it will render all the above three compnent.

Folder Structure of my app is like this
